# Serverless Framework Node Express API on AWS

This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple Node Express API service running on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework.

This template configures a single function, `api`, which is responsible for handling all incoming requests using the `httpApi` event. To learn more about `httpApi` event configuration options, please refer to [httpApi event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/http-api/). As the event is configured in a way to accept all incoming requests, the Express.js framework is responsible for routing and handling requests internally. This implementation uses the `serverless-http` package to transform the incoming event request payloads to payloads compatible with Express.js. To learn more about `serverless-http`, please refer to the [serverless-http README](https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-http).

## Usage

### Dependencies

Install dependencies with:

```
npm install --force
```

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in the following response:

```json
{ "message": "Hello from root!" }
```

### Local development

The easiest way to develop and test your function is to use the `offline` command:

```
serverless offline start
```
